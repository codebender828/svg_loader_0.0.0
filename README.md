# svg_loader_0.0.0
SVG loader sample for a front-end page.
This is a simple project I embarked on today that allows me to use Adobe Illustrator to make some SVG files and then animate them in XML and display them in an HTML webpage. My initial idea was to make a loader for a simple page.

It'd be nice to hear some thoughts from other developers!
